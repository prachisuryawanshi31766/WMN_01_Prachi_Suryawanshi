                            <h2 class="h2-heading"> Story Of Shree Ram Avtar Of Lord Vishnu</h2>
                            <p>Ram also known as Ramchandra is known as the son of Lord Surya and Seventh Avatar of Lord Vishnu in Hinduism.
                                 However, in Valmiki Ramayana, he was the son of Lord Sun (also known as surya). 
                                 When king Dashrath conducted the sacrifice, lord sun presented his portion Rama. Rama's character purely resembles Karna(the chief protagonist of the Mahabharata).
                                  Both were the protagonists of the two greatest epics. Both were the eldest brother but however Yudhisthira and Bharat were crowned the king.
                                   Both had to be deceived by their mother-Kunti and Kaikeyi. Both were the most handsome good-looking person of their respective eras.
                                    Both learnt weaponry through the greatest teacher of all time- Parshurama and Vishwamitra. Despite being a part of royal family, they had to suffer their entire life.
                                     Both possessed not more than 1 wife. Both possessed the bow of Shiva. Parshurama too had a place in the epic of Mahabharata and Ramayana because of the protagonist of the epics- Lord Rama and Karna.

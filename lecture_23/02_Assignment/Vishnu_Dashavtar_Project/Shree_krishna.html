                            <p>
                                Krishna is a major deity in Hinduism. He is worshipped as the eighth avatar of Vishnu and also as the Supreme God in his own right. He is the god of protection, compassion, tenderness, and love and is widely revered among Hindu divinities.
                                 Krishna's birthday is celebrated every year by Hindus on Krishna Janmashtami according to the lunisolar Hindu calendar, which falls in late August or early September of the Gregorian calendar
                                The anecdotes and narratives of Krishna's life are generally titled as Krishna Līlā. He is a central figure in the Mahabharata, the Bhagavata Purana, the Brahma Vaivarta Purana,
                                 and the Bhagavad Gita, and is mentioned in many Hindu philosophical, theological, and mythological texts.
                                 They portray him in various perspectives: as a god-child, a prankster, a model lover, a divine hero, and the universal supreme being.
                                His iconography reflects these legends and shows him in different stages of his life, such as an infant eating butter, a young boy playing a flute, 
                                a young boy with Radha or surrounded by female devotees, or a friendly charioteer giving counsel to Arjuna.

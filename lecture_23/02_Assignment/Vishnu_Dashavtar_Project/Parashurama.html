                            <h2 class="h2-heading"> Story Of Parashurama Avtar Of Lord Vishnu</h2>
                            <p>Parashurama, also known as Parashuram Avatar, was the sixth important avatar of Lord Vishnu. 
                                In this avatar, Lord Vishnu was in the form of a human. He came to Earth to stop Chakravarti Samrat Karthaveerya Arjuna for he had become evil due to his ego and non humility, and as he was very powerful and
                                had the boon of being the embodiment of the Sudarshan Chakra, the gods weren't able to defeat him and all the kshatriyas had become evil under him. Parashurama was the son of sage Jamadagni.
                                It is believed that Parashurama was Chiranjeevi. He was a great devotee of Lord Shiva. Parshurama's mother, Renuka Devi was born of a Kshatriya but she became a Brahmin afterwards .
                                Parashurama was born as Ramabhadra of the Bhargava Clan . He later gained the name of Parashurama when he obtained Mahakaal's Parashu  and lead the Devas to victory against the Asuras in a war in which the Devas were losing.
                                He also played a vital role in Mahabharata, teaching Bheeshma, Dronacharya and Karna the art of war and weaponry and fought against Bheeshma to fulfil Amba's request to kill Bheeshma, though he failed to do so.</p>
